        <h2 id="first">What is REWILD ?</h2>
        <p>REWILD is an organization created by 7 founding associations specializing in the defense, safeguard, seizure, care and rehabilitation of wild animals victims of trade as well as in the conservation and protection of wild animals and their natural habitats.</p>

        <h2 id="second">What are their actions ?</h2>
        <p>To allow the care of the seized animals, REWILD launched a unique challenge, to buy a zoo. This original acquisition came to fruition in December 2019: a rare opportunity to have a suitable reception place for seized animals, and to allow captive individuals to eventually find life in the wild or in sanctuaries.</p>

        <p>The place has a sympathetic capital and a well-established reputation in Brittany and we aim to make it a pioneer in the field of biodiversity conservation. If the animals are no longer already exposed to visitors, after a transition period, the site remains re-open to the public and will offer a new relationship with the wild world.</p>

        <h2 id="third">Who makes up REWILD ?</h2>
        <p>REWILD is the union of several founding associations, Sea Shepherd, Centre Ath√©nas, Le Biome, Hisa, One Voice, Wildlife Angel et Darwin Ecosysteme.</p>
